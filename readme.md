# Germsfox 
## Description
Gotafox is a multiboxing extension for https://gota.io/.
## Features
- Multibox in windowed or tabbed mode
## Installation
Because this extension is still in development and is not available on the Chrome extensions store, you must manually install this program on your computer to run it.
1. Download the source code. You can download it as `.zip` from the green "<> Code" button above, or you may clone the repository.
2. Extract the content of `gotafox-firefox.zip` to its own folder.
3. Navigate to `about:debugging` in Firefox's search bar.
4. On the left side of the page, click on "This Firefox", then "Load Temporary Add-on...".
5. When prompted to select a file, select the `manifest.json` file in the folder you previously extracted from the `.zip` file.
